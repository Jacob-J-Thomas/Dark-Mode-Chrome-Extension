# Dark-Mode-Chrome-Extension
An Adaptable Dark Mode Extension for Specific Domains

The contents.js file contains a few lines of JavaScript that adds a filter to invert the color scheme, which can be easily addapted for any website. The manifest.json file contains the targeted URL's, permissions, and other relevant data Google recquires.

This version of the app targets the helpdesk portal that I have been working in, but I also created another version that works for the Project Management app, Smartsheets.
